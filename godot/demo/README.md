# Live demo — a small Mossflower village

A presentation-only demo (decision 0196). It boots the real game — settlement, simulation clock,
HUD, UIManager — and draws a small village of real library assets on top: buildings, trees,
crops and props at game scale, and eight real rigged residents who walk between work spots with
live tail springs (`TailRig`, decision 0194), grounded clips (0193) and stride-matched speed.
The HUD wears a demo-only woodland skin in the visual language of
`docs/design/ui_refinement/visuals/05_woodland_art_concept.png`.

**Movement here is scripted wandering, not the simulation's.** The settlement's movement
system is not built (MOVE gates are open), so the demo cast is presentation-only and does not
feed the simulation. `scenes/main.tscn` is untouched.

## Run it

```
python3 tools/stage_demo_assets.py      # copy the library assets in (gitignored, ~1.6 GB)
godot --path godot demo/demo_village.tscn
```

Without staging it still runs, on placeholder shapes.
